In this homework, we consider two tasks: {\em word segmentation} and {\em vowel
insertion}.

Word segmentation often comes up when processing many non-English languages, in
which words might not be flanked by spaces on either end, such as written
Chinese or long compound German words.\footnote{In German,
``Windschutzscheibenwischer'' is ``windshield wiper''. Broken into parts:
``wind'' \textrightarrow ``wind''; ``schutz'' \textrightarrow ``block/
protection''; ``scheiben'' \textrightarrow ``panes''; ``wischer''
\textrightarrow ``wiper''.} Vowel insertion is relevant for languages like
Arabic or Hebrew, where modern script eschews notations for vowel sounds and the
human reader infers them from context.\footnote{See
\url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abjad}.} More generally, this is an instance
of a reconstruction problem with a lossy encoding and some context.

We already know how to optimally solve any particular search problem with graph
search algorithms such as uniform cost search or A*.  Our goal here is modeling
--- that is, converting real-world tasks into state-space search problems.
